HHTronik Q.O.K. / I.CAN.SOLDER SMD Challenge
============================================

![HHTronik Q.O.K. / I.CAN.SOLDER Challenge Q.O.K PCB rendering](./assets/pcb-rendering.png)

The question you always had is: how small can it get? Here's the answer: 01005 resistors (that's 0.4x0.2mm) and 0201 LEDs (0.65x0.38mm)

*The question we have is: __are you and your soldering iron ready for this challenge?__*


On this board you'll find:

- a STM8 microcontroller ready for some blinky action
- a small step up driver providing 3.6V to light those blue LEDs
- a PCB-integrated CR20xx battery holder
- polarity protection with reverse battery insertion LED
- a "power good" LED
- 12 footprints to show your soldering skill:
	- 1206 resistor and LED (3.0x1.5 mm / 0.12x0.06 inch)
	- 0805 resistor and LED (2.0x1.3 mm / 0.08x0.05 inch)
	- 0603 resistor and LED (1.5x0.8 mm / 0.06x0.03 inch)
	- 0402 resistor and LED (1.0x0.5 mm / 0.04x0.02 inch)
	- 0201 resistor and LED (0.6x0.3 mm / 0.02x0.01 inch)
	- 01005 resistor and 0201 LED (0.4x0.2 mm / 0.016x0.008 inch)
- Test points to ease probing

What equipement do I need?
--------------------------

- A great soldering iron
- Your favourite solder
- Lots of flux, because flux is life
- Fine tip tweezers
- Lots of Ã¼atience
- a multimeter (ideally with a diode test mode)

As always, work safety is important, so don't burn yourself and don't inhale the fumes released while soldering. Working in a well ventilated area is good. We'd definitely recommend adding some ventilation (for example a fan of some sort blowing the fumes away from you or a proper soldering fume extractor if you plan on doing this over and over again :)

Optionally you may have these things around:

- rubbing alcool or isopropanol
- some lint-free cloth / paper towel
- probably magnifying glasses or a binocular microscope
