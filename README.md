HHTronik Q.O.K. / I.CAN.SOLDER SMD Challenge
============================================

![HHTronik Q.O.K. / I.CAN.SOLDER Challenge Q.O.K PCB rendering](./assets/pcb-rendering.png)

The question you always had is: how small can it get? Here's the answer: 01005 resistors (that's 0.4x0.2mm) and 0201 LEDs (0.65x0.38mm)

*The question we have is: __are you and your soldering iron ready for this challenge?__*


On this board you'll find:

- a STM8 microcontroller ready for some blinky action
- a small step up driver providing 3.6V to light those blue LEDs
- a PCB-integrated CR20xx battery holder
- polarity protection with reverse battery insertion LED
- a "power good" LED
- 12 footprints to show your soldering skill:
	- 1206 resistor and LED (3.0x1.5 mm / 0.12x0.06 inch)
	- 0805 resistor and LED (2.0x1.3 mm / 0.08x0.05 inch)
	- 0603 resistor and LED (1.5x0.8 mm / 0.06x0.03 inch)
	- 0402 resistor and LED (1.0x0.5 mm / 0.04x0.02 inch)
	- 0201 resistor and LED (0.6x0.3 mm / 0.02x0.01 inch)
	- 01005 resistor and 0201 LED (0.4x0.2 mm / 0.016x0.008 inch)
- Test points to ease probing

What equipement do I need?
--------------------------

- A great soldering iron
- Your favourite solder
- Lots of flux, because flux is life
- Fine tip tweezers
- Lots of Ã¼atience
- a multimeter (ideally with a diode test mode)

As always, work safety is important, so don't burn yourself and don't inhale the fumes released while soldering. Working in a well ventilated area is good. We'd definitely recommend adding some ventilation (for example a fan of some sort blowing the fumes away from you or a proper soldering fume extractor if you plan on doing this over and over again :)

Optionally you may have these things around:

- rubbing alcool or isopropanol
- some lint-free cloth / paper towel
- probably magnifying glasses or a binocular microscope

How should I solder that Oo?!?

If you chose the Standard edition, all of the above comes presoldered, which will make your life somewhat easier :) If you didn't, then - well - good luck! Especially the STM8 microcontroller is tricky to solder even though we extended the pads a bit in orders to make it at least doable for you! Our reccommendation would be to start with a single pin to tack the controller down and to do drag soldering with a chisel tip on your soldering iron. Oh! And lots of flux :)

Other than that things are pretty easy:

- the SC-70 package in the top left corner is Q1
- next to it is a R1 / 1k 0402
- top right is LED_RP / a red 0805 led
- left beneath Q1 comes L1 (a bit tricky to solder do that one first maybe? :D)
- U1 is easy peasy with its chunky SOT23-3
- the LED in the bottom right corner is LED_PG (green 0805) with it's current limiting resistor (1k 0402) just above
- the (big) 0805 MLCCs are 10uF each
- the two 0402 caps in the bottom center are both 1uF (C3 and C5)
- the single 0402 cap in the top left of the microcontroller is C4 / 100nF

Refer to [/firmware/README](./firmware/) for instruction regarding the setup of the development environment (Platform.IO) and programming.

I don't know anything about electronics, what can I learn?
